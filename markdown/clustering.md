# Clustering

Clustering is a form of Unsupervised Learning where we are trying to find the underlying structure of our data. One form of clustering is K-Means. In this process, we attempt to form K clusters of our data by taking the mean of a cluster after each iteration. We can see an example of this in the figure below:
